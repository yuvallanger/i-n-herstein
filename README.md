### Page 5 - Prove: A = (A cap B) cup (A - B)

(thanks Z-module)

#### LHS => RHS

```
for each x in A
   if x in B
     x in (A cap B)
     x in ((A cap B) cup (A - B))
   if x not in B
     x in (A - B)
     x in ((A cap B) cup (A - B))
```

#### RHS => LHS

```
for each x in ((A cap B) cup (A - B))
  if x in (A cap B)
    x in A and x in B
  if x in (A - B)
    x in A and x not in B
  i.e. for both cases we see:
    (x in A and x in B) or (x in A and x not in B)
  logical manipulation gives us that for both cases:
    x in A
```

### Page 7 - Prove Example 1.1.3

```
n is integer and greater than one.
a ~ b if a - b is a multiple of n.
```

#### a ~ a

```
a - a = 0, which is a multiple of n.
```

#### a ~ b => b ~ a

```
if (a - b) is a multiple of n the negative of (a - b) is (b - a) which is also a multiple of n.
```

#### a ~ b and b ~ c => a ~ c

```
a - b is a multiple of n.
b - c is a multiple of n.
a - c = (a - b) + (b - c)
the addition of two multiples of n will result with a multiple of n.
```
