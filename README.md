### Page 5 - Prove: A = (A cap B) cup (A - B)

(thanks Z-module)

#### LHS => RHS

```
for each x in A
   if x in B
     x in (A cap B)
     x in ((A cap B) cup (A - B))
   if x not in B
     x in (A - B)
     x in ((A cap B) cup (A - B))
```

#### RHS => LHS

```
for each x in ((A cap B) cup (A - B))
  if x in (A cap B)
    x in A and x in B
  if x in (A - B)
    x in A and x not in B
  i.e. for both cases we see:
    (x in A and x in B) or (x in A and x not in B)
  logical manipulation gives us that for both cases:
    x in A
```
